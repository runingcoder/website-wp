<p>This was out first 42 km marathon attempt which we both completed in 3 hour 30 minutes  and 4 hour 6 minute time respectively. Saying &#8220;It was a fun day&#8221; would be an under as well as over statement at the same time. We had to go back to the bus station limping about 500 meters. And the rest is history. As in, couldn&#8217;t move our body for some days. So much for a marathon without training. Or, with minimal training..</p>
